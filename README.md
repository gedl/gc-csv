Command line utility to export Google Contacts  to a Comma Separated File

I wrote this tool because couldn't find any command line option to export google contacts to a CSV file.

A very simple command line tool to generate CSV files for google contacts.

Requires users to create an application in the google dev console and configure OAuth client id and secret. Check here: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2

This can be compiled from source (it's a maven project) but ready-to-use jar files are available from the releases page, here: https://github.com/gedl/gc-csv/releases
